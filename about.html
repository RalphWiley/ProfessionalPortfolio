            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="item1">
                <p>I have a passion for every art form and writing software is another means to that end. 
                    I enjoy writing front-end code that uses either CSS Materialize or Bootstrap and soon to be SASS. 
                    While I love the frontend I also have backend experience with Node JS and SQL. 
                    Using Git on the command line is something that is increasingly becoming my favorite tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I might have only lived in and around Overland Park but that hasnâ€™t stopped me from 
                    traveling around the world. I studied Film and Media at The University of Kansas where I took 20+ 
                    credits a semester while working part-time and partaking in internships while always maintaining a GPA above 3.7.  
                    I lost my passion for the film industry when I met my future self in L.A. whom was editing The Bachelor for 18 hours a day on minimum pay.  
                    I believe in working hard but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is just as important.  I enjoy rock climbing, critiquing art and playing board games with friends and family.
