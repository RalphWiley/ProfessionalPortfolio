I have a passion for every art form and writing software is another means to that end. I enjoy writing front-end code that uses either CSS Materialize or Bootstrap and soon to be SASS. While I love the frontend I also have backend experience with Node JS and SQL. Using Git on the command line is something that is increasingly becoming my favorite tool.
